## Features

- Counts from 0 (000) to 7 (111) in binary, covering all 3-bit combinations.
- Three LEDs display the binary output, each representing one bit.
- Easily observe the counter state through the LED indicators.
- Optimized for a small, easy-to-assemble printed circuit board.
- Ideal for learning and demonstrating binary counting and digital electronics basics.
- Uses standard logic ICs and LEDs for efficient operation.
